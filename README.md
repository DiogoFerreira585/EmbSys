# Mouse Trap

## Known Bugs
- there is a stuck state on the Communication Center endpoint (occurrences:Low | replicate:Hard)
- after some time multim.py eventually dies with Input/Output error (occurrences:High | replicate: High)
- after enough time, number holding variables will break (prediction) 

## To Do
1) add photo support - DOING
2) mobile - ON HOLD
3) when sensor_e is sent a photo should also be
4) last state and re-setup
5) proper shutdown and block in arduino
6) ipv4 as an argument support
7) ultrasound sensor is not 100% reliable (not much we can do)
