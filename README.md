# Mouse Trap

## Known Bugs
- there is a stuck state on the Communication Center endpoint (occurrences:Low | replicate:Hard)
- after some time multim.py eventually dies with Input/Output error (occurrences:High | replicate: High)


## To Do
- sensor_e is not 100% being detected
- add photo support
- when sensor_e is sent a photo should also be
- open_e and close_e need to be modeled in ino
- last state and re-setup
- proper shutdown and block in arduino
