# Mouse Trap

## Known Bugs
- there is a stuck state on the Communication Center endpoint (occurrences:Low | replicate:Hard)
- after some time multim.py eventually dies with Input/Output error (occurrences:High | replicate: High)
- after enough time, number holding variables will break (prediction)
- timeout will be needed (prediction)

## To Do
1) add photo support - DOING
2) ultrasound sensor is not 100% reliable - but code isn't helping as well
3) mobile - ON HOLD
4) when sensor_e is sent a photo should also be
5) last state and re-setup
6) proper shutdown and block in arduino
7) ipv4 as an argument support
